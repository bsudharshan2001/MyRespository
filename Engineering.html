          <h3>B. Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) in Aerospace Engineering</h3><hr>
          <p>The Department of Aerospace Engineering (AE) started in the year of 2007, in order to meet the needs and trends 
            of the current requirements in the Aerospace industries. Presently, the Department offers B. Tech. program in Aerospace
             Engineering with intake of 60 students per batch.<br><br>
             The prescribed courses of study and syllabi, cover core areas like, aero-design, structures,
                propulsion, aerodynamics and systems, and also areas like Physical Sciences, Humanities and Social Harmony.
                 The department is headed by an eminent professor, Dr. J. Chandrasekhar, having more than 35 years of experience
                  in the department of Aerospace engineering at IIT-Bombay.<br><br>
             The onerous task of setting up state-of-the-art laboratories in various fields of study, has
                become doubly challenging for the Department. Based on its vast research and teaching experience 
                (from reputed institutions in India and abroad), the faculty of the department, has taken up the challenge.<br><br>
                The laboratories and workshops, detailed in the curriculum, have been framed to take up the challenges in industry and
                 focus on research and development.Tie-ups with the pioneering institutions like NAL, ISRO, DRDO, IITs etc., 
                 have served as eye-openers on the complexities of real life problems. Both students and faculty involve themselves 
                 in searching for solutions.</p><br>
